# Cult Beauty Frontend test

Your task is to create a page of html and accompanying css which will look like Gift_landing_page_final.jpg. There are specifications gift_landing_page_instructions.jpg and a set of image to use in the images directory.

## Animation

Over each of the subcategory images is an overlay with the name of the category on it. When the user mouses over the category image it the overlay should expand to reveal a short piece of text and the 'Shop Category Name' button. You can see an example of this effect on gift_landing_page_instructions.jpg - Skincare Gifts is in the mouseover state.

## Header and footer

You don't need to recreate the Cult Beauty header and footer in CSS and live text - PNGs have been provided for you in the template directory to put in their place.

## Fonts

For the subcategory overlays the font 'Dubiel' is used. You can find it here as a free download: http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/dubielplain

It's tricky if not impossible to run web fonts from a HTML in the browser on a file:// protocol, so you'll need to put your example file on a webserver. If you have a test server already, you can develop it on there, otherwise check out these one-liners that should make a quick web server out of whatever scripting language you have installed already https://gist.github.com/willurd/5720255

## Deliverables

Please produce a zip file with all assets needed for the page and the main file named index.html
